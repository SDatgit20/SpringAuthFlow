# Spring Boot JWT Authentication with BCryptPasswordEncoder

This is a Spring Boot-based login application that implements JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and uses BCryptPasswordEncoder for secure password hashing. The application allows users to log in with their credentials, authenticate via JWT, and access protected resources.

## Features

- JWT Authentication: Secure and stateless authentication using JWT tokens.
- Password Security: Uses BCryptPasswordEncoder for hashing passwords before storing them.
- Role-based Authorization: Protects endpoints based on user roles (e.g., ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN).
- Spring Security: Configures Spring Security to authenticate and authorize users.
